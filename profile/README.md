# Goal

Our goal is to adapt the **Redmi kernel structure** to the **Manjaro distribution structure**, so you can use the Manjaro distribution structure directly through the adapted kernel structure.

> **Note:** This distribution is copyrighted by Manjaro, but the development rights belong to Azccriminal.
